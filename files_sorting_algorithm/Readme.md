**What algorithm has better run time?**

Quicksort and Merge Sort have the better runtime. 
Merge sort is better for 50000 items or less, but quicksort is better for more than 50000. Both
 algorithms have similar behaviour because are recursive and divide the array many times.
 In general Quicksort is the fastest sorting algorithm. 
   
**Are your empirical results consistent with the theoretical complexity of the algorithms?
Yes, are consistent. The complexities are**

Bubble sort: 0(n^2)

Insertion sort: 0(n^2)

Selection sort: 0(n^2)

MergeSort 0(n * log(n))

QuickSort 0(n * log(n))
